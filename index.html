            <p class="pL">The <b>Earth system</b> is a complex system made up of four independent spheres: the atmosphere, hydrosphere, geosphere and biosphere. These spheres interact constantly, shaping our planet's climate, landscapes, and ecosystems. Understanding these spheres allows us to help explain natural processes such as weather patterns, heat transfer, and currents of the ocean. Each sphere has unique characteristics working together to make our planet function.</p>

            <p class="pR">The <b>atmosphere</b> is the layer of gases surrounding Earth, composed primarily of nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%), with trace amounts of other gases like carbon dioxide and argon. It is comprised of five different layers, the exosphere, thermosphere, mesosphere, stratosphere, and troposphere. It regulates temperature, shields the planet from solar radiation with the ozone layer, and enables weather and climate to occur. The air we breathe, or cyclones, an aurora, etc, are all examples of the atmosphere. Atmospheric movements, such as wind and storms, influence ocean currents and ecosystems, demonstrating its interaction with other spheres.</p>

            <p class="pL">The <b>hydrosphere</b> represents and includes all water on Earth in all of its forms: solid, liquid, and gas. Oceans, lakes, rivers, snow, and glaciers are a part of this sphere. The hydropshere is important for sustaining life, shaping landscapes through processes of erosion, and impacting climate patterns with the water cycle. It also transfers and absorbs heat into the ocean and its currents. It interacts with the atmosphere through evapouration and precipitation and with the geosphere through erosion and sediment transport.</p>

            <p class="pR">The <b>Geosphere</b> refers to Earth's internal, solid components and layers. This includes the inner core, outer core, mantle, and crust. It encompasses mountains, rocks, soil, and minerals. The geosphere is the foundation for other spheres, influencing landscapes and ecosystems. Geological processes like volcanic eruptions and earthquakes shape the surface, while the geosphere interacts with the biosphere by providing essential nutrients for life.</p>

            <p class="pL">The <b>biosphere</b> consists of all living organisms, from microscopic bacteria to vast forests and marine life. It depends on the other spheres for survivalâ€”air from the atmosphere, water from the hydrosphere, and nutrients from the geosphere. In turn, life influences Earth's systems, such as plants producing oxygen and humans altering landscapes. The biosphere is the most dynamic sphere, constantly adapting to environmental changes.</p>
